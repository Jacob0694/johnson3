Tea/Camera App

Reviewer 1

Functionality: 
The code ran, however some of the functions didn't work as expected. The tea selection screen worked exactly the way it was supposed to. The back to tea selection on the camera screen button didn't work, neither did the show camera function. The back to tea selection button didn't work because of a syntactically wrong event listener. Other than that, the code ran fine. 

Phone Gadget: 
The camera code ran fine, no error message appeared telling the user that the emulator couldn't access the camera, but that isn't that important. This funciton could've been added with the line "error: function(e) {alert..." under success line 125. 

Navigation: 
Navigation works going from the tea selection to the camera however not the other way around, as I stated earlier, this could've been fixed by tweaking the syntax of the event listener.
